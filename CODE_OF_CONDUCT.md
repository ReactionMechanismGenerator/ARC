# ARC Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as contributors and maintainers are committed to fostering an open, welcoming, and inclusive environment. We pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of:

- age  
- body size  
- disability  
- ethnicity  
- gender identity or expression  
- level of experience  
- nationality  
- personal appearance  
- race  
- religion  
- sexual identity or orientation

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language  
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences  
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism  
- Focusing on what is best for the community  
- Showing empathy toward other community members  

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances  
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks  
- Public or private harassment  
- Publishing others’ private information (e.g. a physical or electronic address) without explicit permission  
- Any other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting  

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to instances of unacceptable behavior.

They have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. Maintainers may also ban, temporarily or permanently, any contributor for behavior deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within project spaces and also in public spaces where an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representation include:

- Using an official project email address  
- Posting via an official social media account  
- Acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event  

Project maintainers may further define what constitutes representation.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at alongd@mit.edu.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Responses will be tailored to the circumstances, and appropriate measures will be taken.

Maintainers who fail to uphold or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face consequences including temporary or permanent removal from the project’s leadership or community.
