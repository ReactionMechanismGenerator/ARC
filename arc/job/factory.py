                                    Keys are either 'keyword' or 'block', values are dictionaries with values to be used
                                    either as keywords or as blocks in the respective software input file. If given as
                                    a string, it will be converted to a dictionary format with ``'keyword'`` and

                                      1-indexed atom indices (the list length determined the constraint type),
                                      and the second entry is the constraint value in Angstroms or degrees.
        cpu_cores (int, optional): The total number of cpu cores requested for a job.
                                   ARC adopts the following naming system to describe computing hardware hierarchy:

        ess_settings (dict, optional): A dictionary of available ESS and a corresponding server list.
        ess_trsh_methods (List[str], optional): A list of troubleshooting methods already tried out.

                                     ``'running'``, ``'errored'``, or ``'done'``. The job ESS status is in job_status[1]
                                     and it is a dict of: {'status': str, 'keywords': list, 'error': str, 'line': str}.

        #                                     determine it). Defaults to None. Important, e.g., if a Species is a bi-rad
        #                                     singlet, in which case the job should be unrestricted with
        #                                     multiplicity = 1.  # use the species
        # radius (float, optional): The species radius in Angstrom.  # use the species
